Major changes (5/14)


>  Sub-batch feature added to handle big batch files
   * small (sub) batch files are 5 entries
   * big batch files are 10+ entries

> Re-login feature added
    * Users can now remain idle in the application.
      Upon login, credentials are cached and used
      to log the user back in during inactivity triggers

> App now shuts down completely without hanging
    * Long standing issue where quitting by user request (Q) would not successfully quit,
      instead hanging due to ongoing loops (listen() being the likely culprit)
    * app now shuts down its (now) two ongoing while loops by checking for a quit request

> Some cleanups around code segments

> Notes:
    * Batch file configurations to account for
      RDU101/UNITY are still pending.
    * Ran into issues with DOM selection of element
      with firmware data. 
    * Working on allowing "Enter" key to work on option selection menu
