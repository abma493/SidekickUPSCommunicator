6/30-7/1 Update:

* Batch screen job labels had updates missing (Not fatal to program flow)
* Edit screen loads data from prev entered by user (if so, otherwise defaults to Single at first time)
* Mod Network screen displays and allows edit for gateway configuration (was overlooked earlier)
* some code cleanup (comments, etc.), more on the way
* OK button on Edit screen disappearing issue corrected

* Most issues where the "Mode: <Mode>" string alters the UI structure have been corrected
    > UI issues with alignment of mode label persist with options 3 and 5.

* Some minor UI touch-ups on Batch screen
    > Added more meaningful error strings on job lists 
    > Reaching Host error & Authentication failed error (if subset of devices have diff. credentials)
