6/30 Update:

* Batch screen job labels had updates missing (Not fatal to program flow)
* Edit screen loads data from prev entered by user (if so, otherwise defaults to Single at first time)
* Mod Network screen displays and allows edit for gateway configuration (was overlooked earlier)
* some code cleanup (comments, etc.), more on the way
