    * Work began on ScanNet feature which will be used ID'ing UPS devices by scanning a network and its subnets.
    * snmp implementation started to collect UPS stats.
    * Design created for implementation of the following UI screens / user tools:
        > ScanNet (UI base implementation complete.)
            * params editor (modal screen)
            * possibly a stand-alone feature that is added to Sidekick but can be used on CLI
        > Reporter
            * Show stats (load, battery state, temperature, etc.)
            * Generate a report 
                > using ScanNet or loading a batch file of devices
                > filters available (below/above, integer input, etc.)

    * Minor log output cleanup.
