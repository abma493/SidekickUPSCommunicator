More changes:
	* Application now halts jobs if their associated device is not compatible
	  with uploaded firmware file. 
	
What can be improved?
	
	> Code cleanup required for the most-recently worked files (Batch/driver/etc)
	  Other files also need to be reworked to comply with organization/coherence
	
	> Abort All is still broken, it works only on first sub-batch
	
	> When user selects "Abort all", it does not give him option to go 
	  back to main menu or exit the application.
	
	> If one job in the small batch fails, it will take waiting all 3 retries
	  before loading a new small batch
	
	> Changing fixed path on user path input (Edit screen)
	
	> Allow parsing for csv files.
	
	> There appears to be a sync issue where multiple REQ_CREDS are being made 
	  when first logging in. This may be an edge case as it doesn't happen every
	  time.
		
	> UI Option selection: allow "Enter" as an alternative to num. select
