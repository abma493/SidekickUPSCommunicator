Continue redo of Option 1

Now that it fetches its data from the config file, user input should bypass playwright and simply edit
a field value in the respective tuple. Such tuple is sent back to the driver with the master curated copy
of the config file. The driver will use the passed tuple to identify the key and pass in the modified value
to the dictionary of config entries. 

The user will have the option to "Apply" the changes in the Option 1 screen, otherwise, the user may 
"Apply all changes" in Main menu screen, or if they choose to quit the app, it will prompt the user with a dialog
that will read: "You have # unsaved changes. Do you wish to apply them?"

If the user selects "yes", the aiohttp will import a new file with the selected changes. Then, 
playwright will communicate with the web server to oversee a card restart.
NOTE: Not all changes require a restart.
