More changes:
	* Quit and Back added to Batch screen. Will become disabled on "run" unless
	  abort is called.
	  
	* Export drop-down box cutoff was fixed on Batch screen.
	
	* Threshold for the CHK_LOGOUT is changed from 120s to 15s on Batch screen.
	  On return/back, threshold should be changed back to 120s. Addresses
	  prolonged inactivity during batch operations.
	  
	* restart function (option 6) has been fixed and works as intended.
	
	* OptionScreen can now select options with Enter key (num. select 
	  still available)
	
	* Removed the use of mini_wait for robustness in login/driver.
