Work Notes 5/30:

> Optimization using aiohttp for BatchScreen. Created direct http request routines
  for import/export that do not require DOM loading.

> Created individual program files for import/export, which should facilitate all operations.
  Testing pending for how to append multiple changes (opts 1-5)   

> Some code cleanup, minor work on man-pages.
