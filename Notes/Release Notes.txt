########### Sidekick Communicator v.2.1 ###########

It's finally here! (*Drum roll*) A very niche tool for a specific brand-model UPS line of devices! 
Well... at least it can get USEFUL stuff done :)

Steps to install:
    Not yet! 


Developer Notes:
* Some parts of the program are made slower due to the overhead caused by the playwright web scraping tool. Unfortunately,
  it's easier and so far quickest to perform restarts and firmware updates using playwright. I've kept a class variable at 
  the driver for a playwright instance, thus the login is insufferably slower than it could be with aiohttp. BUT it makes
  the current device's restart/firmware upgrade significantly faster since it doesn't have to go through the login overhead
  except when starting the app for the first time. However, the same cannot be said for batch operations, which always create
  a playwright instance per batch item. A solution to simply use aiohttp in replacement of playwright is underway, but it may
  be some time before this happens...

* I intend to implement a tool extension to this app called "ScanNet", which should essentially pull all the pingable IPs
  associated to Vertiv UPS devices, along with their card type. By doing this, a user would be able to export files separating
  those devices by card types, and choose to run batch operations on each. It seems like a neat extension that won't need more
  than a few tricks. This tool is an idea as of this release and it may be some time before it happens.
