Major changes:
    
    > BatchOptScreen (Opt 6)
        - is now UI responsive during job task execution
        - can now select between Import and Export
        - can now abort all jobs
        - can Import files and await the "reboot" message on DOM (still needs to wait for appropriate reboot confirmation)
        - inchoate import error handling by asking users to check import log on webUI (need to make this better!)
    
Improvements
    > RestartScreenPrompt needs Label updates for notifying user that webcard is restarting 
    > Selecting batch mode MUST require batch file; if config file not supplied, Import option disabled on Opt 6
    > If in batch mode, pressing E should populate the file path fields with the existing file paths
    > Handle logout due to inactivty (if user stalls on Communicator app)


Next steps
    > Incorporate BatchOpsScreen with the rest of the program
    > Push firmware update (Opt 5)
    > Implement the rest of the options (should be the easier ones, for last!)
