Major changes:
    
    > Option 1 can now push changes and restart card to apply them (DHCP mod has not been tested though)
        > back button and selecting option 1 again will reload current data
    > EditScreen exists now to modify app mode (Single or Batch)
        > A batch file and config file is now stored in-memory 
    
Improvements
    > RestartScreenPrompt needs Label updates for notifying user that webcard is restarting 
    > Selecting batch mode MUST require both files to be supplied and checked before continuing
    > If in batch mode, pressing E should populate the file path fields with the existing file paths


Next steps
    > Create a class to handle batch operation of applying a configuration file to its webcard
