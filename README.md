The Vertiv-compatible UPS "Vertiv Communicator" is a lightweight application currently in development (just Windows at the moment) to communicate with webcards for Vertiv UPS devices.
This application serves as a tool to do simple modifications on a single device, but it stands out for handling batches of webcards for configuration changes including configuration files and firmware updates. 

My project has no affiliation with Vertiv.

As of 5/15/2025:

This project is still in progress, and work is planned for Unix-like environment compatibility.
There may (and most likely are) be hiccups when running large (10+) batch files. At this time this is still being polished.
Most other options are not yet functional besides 1/7 (Batch)/6.
