The Vertiv-compatible UPS Communicator", or Communicator for short (name by itself isn't cool, I need to prefix Communicator with something else...) is a lightweight tool currently in development for Unix-like and Windows machines to communicate with webcards for Vertiv UPS devices.

I intend to expand functionality to Vertiv PDUs and Watchdogs, but that'll be later. Also, I can't affix "Vertiv" to this project canonically so please don't sue me, I have NO affiliation with Vertiv, my organization simply uses their products :)
