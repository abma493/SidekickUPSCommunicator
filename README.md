The Vertiv-compatible UPS Communicator, or "Communicator" for short, is a lightweight application currently in development for Unix-like and Windows machines to communicate with webcards for Vertiv UPS devices.
This application serves as a tool to do simple modifications on a single device, but it stands out for handling batches of webcards for configuration changes including configuration files and firmware updates. 

I intend to expand functionality to Vertiv PDUs and Watchdogs, but that'll be later. My project has no affiliation with Vertiv, as I am only their customer, and this product is simply a solution for their absence of proper configuration tools for devices en masse.

This project is still in progress.
